# bike-share-sim-nugget

#This project is all about simulation and optimization. Here we're pulling data for over 1.5 million journeys accross 700+ docking stations in London's bike share network and #asking two simple questions: 
#1) How can we estimate the number of bad experiences occuring for customers?
#2) How can we optimize this system?

#In order to answer these questions, we first need to define what we mean by bad experiences. Bad experiences here come in two forms - either a customer tries to rent a bike at a #station which is empty, or tries to return a bike at a station which is full. Whether either one of these things happens is in turn a function of docking station inventory,     #capacity, and random demand at each station over a given period of time. In more formal terms, we need to model the random variables of customers arriving and departing from #stations with fixed capacity (a constriant of this problem) for the purpose of estimating the expected values for bad experiences. This is possible using a stochastic simulation #method (i.e. simulating interactions many thousands of times). Bike inventory levels at the start of each defined period of time for each station here represent our decision #variable. By iterating over all the possibilities, we can determine what the optimal inventory levels are for each station at the start of each defined period of time.
